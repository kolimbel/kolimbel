### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Engineering graduate from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, currently pursuing my Master's degree in the field of AI. My primary goal is to develop my skills as a Java Engineer and contribute to the industry with my knowledge.

I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Most of the projects I have shared on my profile are small student tasks that I completed during my studies. However, I am always open to collaborating and contributing to more substantial projects.
